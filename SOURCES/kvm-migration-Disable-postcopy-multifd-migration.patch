RH-Commit: [1/1] 07d26fbac35b7586fe790304f03d316ed26a4ef2

Since the introduction of multifd, it's possible to perform a multifd
migration and finish it using postcopy.

A bug introduced by yank (fixed on cfc3bcf373) was previously preventing
a successful use of this migration scenario, and now thing should be
working on most scenarios.

But since there is not enough testing/support nor any reported users for
this scenario, we should disable this combination before it may cause any
problems for users.
