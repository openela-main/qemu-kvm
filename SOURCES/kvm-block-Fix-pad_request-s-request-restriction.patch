Subject: [PATCH 5/5] block: Fix pad_request's request restriction

RH-Author: Hanna Czenczek <hreitz@redhat.com>
RH-MergeRequest: 291: block: Split padded I/O vectors exceeding IOV_MAX
RH-Bugzilla: 2141964
RH-Acked-by: Emanuele Giuseppe Esposito <eesposit@redhat.com>

RH-Commit: [5/5] f9188bd089d6c67185ea1accde20d491a2ed3193

bdrv_pad_request() relies on requests' lengths not to exceed SIZE_MAX,
which bdrv_check_qiov_request() does not guarantee.

bdrv_check_request32() however will guarantee this, and both of
bdrv_pad_request()'s callers (bdrv_co_preadv_part() and
bdrv_co_pwritev_part()) already run it before calling
bdrv_pad_request().  Therefore, bdrv_pad_request() can safely call
bdrv_check_request32() without expecting error, too.

In effect, this patch will not change guest-visible behavior.  It is a
clean-up to tighten a condition to match what is guaranteed by our
callers, and which exists purely to show clearly why the subsequent
assertion (`assert(*bytes <= SIZE_MAX)`) is always true.

Note there is a difference between the interfaces of
bdrv_check_qiov_request() and bdrv_check_request32(): The former takes
an errp, the latter does not, so we can no longer just pass
&error_abort.  Instead, we need to check the returned value.  While we
do expect success (because the callers have already run this function),
an assert(ret == 0) is not much simpler than just to return an error if
it occurs, so let us handle errors by returning them up the stack now.
