Subject: [PATCH 2/6] block/nbd: Assert there are no timers when closed

RH-Author: Hanna Reitz <hreitz@redhat.com>
RH-MergeRequest: 117: block/nbd: Handle AioContext changes
RH-Commit: [2/6] 995795ae9844a7d2b28cb1e57fd7fe81482d0205
RH-Bugzilla: 2035185

Our two timers must not remain armed beyond nbd_clear_bdrvstate(), or
they will access freed data when they fire.

This patch is separate from the patches that actually fix the issue
(HEAD^^ and HEAD^) so that you can run the associated regression iotest
(281) on a configuration that reproducibly exposes the bug.

(cherry picked from commit 8a39c381e5e407d2fe5500324323f90a8540fa90)

Conflict:
- block/nbd.c: open_timer was introduced after the 6.2 release (for
  nbd's @open-timeout parameter), and has not been backported, so drop
  the assertion that it is NULL
